This command line application was thought to be efficient and easy to maintain.
Application was tested and looks like it is working correct - it saves order log and event log into two different files, 
but during development lazy programmer was working on the app...

Please refactor this application to be efficient, reliable and easier to maintain 
according to your understanding of efficient, reliable and easy to maintain application
(requirements to this application might change on a daily basis!).

Example command to run the app
```
 node src/app.js 35 customer-one private 1180
```

Please do not modify test.js file, test should pass after refactoring.
